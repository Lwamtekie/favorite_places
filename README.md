technologies used: index.html, main.css, main.js, json.data

This project is called "place to visit" is different form the pervious assignments, because all the data for favorite places is in Json file not in main.js. So main.js has only the Print To Dom and the domString to style the bootstrap card. The styling and color is in main.css.
